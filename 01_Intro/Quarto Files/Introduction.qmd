## Plane Crash \| \small Intro

```

You and your group have just survived the crash of a small plane...

## Plane Crash \| \small Story

\justifying

Both the pilot and co-pilot were killed in the crash. It is mid-January, and you are in Northern Canada. The daily temperature is -25$^{\circ}F$ (or -32$^{\circ}C$) and the night time temperature is -40$^{\circ}F$ (or -40$^{\circ}C$). There is snow on the ground, and the countryside is wooded with several creeks criss-crossing the area. The nearest town is 20 miles away. You are all dressed in city clothes appropriate for a business meeting.

## Plane Crash \| \small Materials

Your group of survivors managed to salvage the following items:

```{=tex}
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{itemize}
  \item a ball of steel wool
  \item a small ax
  \item a loaded .45-caliber pistol
  \item can of Crisco shortening
  \item newspapers (one per person)
  \item cigarette lighter (without fluid)
  \item extra shirt and pants for each survivor
  \item 20 \(\displaystyle \times \) 20 ft. piece of heavy-duty canvas
  \item a sectional air map made of plastic
  \item one quart of 100-proof whiskey
  \item a compass
  \item family-size chocolate bars (one per person)
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
```

## Plane Crash \| \small Individual

\justifying

Rank the items according to their importance to your survival, starting with \textbf{1} for the most important item to \textbf{12} for the least important. Work quickly, alone, and \textit{don't} discuss the problem with anyone in your group. Record your rankings in the scoring table down column A labeled \textbf{Individual Ranking}.

## Plane Crash \| \small Group

\justifying

In your group, share your top \textbf{three} most important items and explain why you think each item is important. As a group, discuss what items are most critical for survival. You should try to come to a consensus as the more everyone agrees, the more likely you and your group will survive. Once there is a consensus, record the group rankings in the scoring table down column B labeled \textbf{Group Ranking}.

## Plane Crash \| \small Survived?

```{=tex}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 0-12: Great survival skills -- rescued!
  \item 13-24: Above average survival skills -- rescued!
  \item 25-36: Frostbit, hungry, and tired -- rescued!
  \item 37-48: Dehydrated and barely alive -- it was tough, but rescued!
  \item 49-60: Rescued, but only just in time! Lost a few toes.
  \item 61-72: Sorry, only scraps of your clothing were recovered months after the search was called off.
\end{itemize}
