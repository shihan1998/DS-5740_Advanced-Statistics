# DS-5740 Advanced Statistics for Data Scientists

## Course Description

Predicting future outcomes is fundamental to human activity. Understanding how past events lead to current conditions can enables us to make predictions about the future. This course will focus on how we can predictions about the future based on past evidence. Applied uses include forecasting market outcomes (e.g., stocks, company earnings) to human behavior (e.g., emotions, public health policy).

The majority of the course covers time series forecasting to use past performance patterns to make predictions about the future. Key topics in this component includes regression, decomposition, smoothing, ARIMA models, and dynamic covariation. A second component will focus on applying dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), exploratory graph analysis (EGA), and k-means clustering to survey data. A third component of this course will focus on A/B testing (also referred to as experimental design). In this component, weâ€™ll cover how we can manipulate different features of the stimulus/environment to uncover predictions about behavior.
